API updates, new endpoints, SDK releases, and developer-focused features.

## October 27, 2025

- **Enhanced Filtering Capabilities:** Major improvements to the search filtering API with new `string_contains` filter type for partial string matching, `ignoreCase` option for case-insensitive string operations, and improved negation support across all filter types including proper numeric equality negation. The implementation also includes enhanced SQL injection protection and wildcard escaping for improved security.

## September 17, 2025

- **Forgotten Memories Search:** New `include.forgottenMemories` parameter in v4 search API allows searching through memories that have been explicitly forgotten or expired. Set to `true` to include forgotten memories in search results, helping recover previously archived information.

## September 14, 2025

- **Enhanced Delete API:** `DELETE /v3/documents/:id` endpoint now supports both internal document ID and customId for flexible document deletion. Developers can now delete documents using the same customId provided during creation, improving API consistency with other endpoints.
- **API Terminology Clarification:** Refined API terminology from "memories" to "documents" for improved developer clarity. New `/v3/documents/*` endpoints provide more intuitive naming while maintaining full backward compatibility via automatic redirects from `/v3/memories/*`. No action required from existing integrations.
